# GDI_Destruct
Malware made in C# You need .net 3.5 to run it. Do not run this on your main pc as this will overwrite the MBR I am not held responsible for any damages caused by this application. 

The GDI ONLY version does everything that the regular GDI_Destruct does but doesnt overwrite the MBR.

Always make sure you run this on a virtual machine
